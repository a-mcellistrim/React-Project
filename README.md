## Quick Start

1. Install [node 16.17.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v16.17.0/)
2. Install [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
3. Open the project folder in WebStorm 
4. Under Settings > Languages & Frameworks > Node.js, set the installed
location of node.exe for the Node Interpreter
5. Run "Install" from WebStorm (or run `npm install` in this project directory)
6. Run "Start" from WebStorm (or open package.json in WebStorm and click the green Run arrow for `start` in scripts - `npm start` will also probably work from a terminal)
